-- 5. DATA HEALTH CHECK
-- ============================================
SELECT

SELECT * FROM data_health_check;

-- Should show 0 for all issue types!

-- ============================================
-- 6. RLS POLICY CHECK

-- ============================================
-- 10. TEST RLS (Run as authenticated user)
-- ============================================
SELECT

-- This will show what the current authenticated user can see
-- Run this after logging into your app

FROM users;

SELECT 
  'Visible Devices:' as label,
  COUNT(*) as value
FROM devices;

SELECT 
  'Visible Energy Logs:' as label,
  COUNT(*) as value

-- ============================================
-- TROUBLESHOOTING QUERIES
-- ============================================

-- If you see "permission denied" errors, check:
-- 1. Is RLS enabled?
SELECT 
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 2. Do policies exist?
SELECT 
  tablename,
  COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 3. Are auth users linked to database users?
SELECT 
  'Auth users not in database:' as issue,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN users u ON au.id = u.id
WHERE u.id IS NULL;

-- ============================================
-- QUICK FIXES
-- ============================================

-- If you need to reset assigned_users on an energy log:
-- UPDATE energy_logs 
-- SET assigned_users = ARRAY['USER_ID_HERE']::UUID[]
-- WHERE id = 'LOG_ID_HERE';

-- If you need to recalculate costs (trigger will auto-run):
-- UPDATE energy_logs 
-- SET updated_at = NOW()
-- WHERE id = 'LOG_ID_HERE';

-- If you need to change a device's wattage:
-- UPDATE devices 
-- SET wattage = NEW_WATTAGE
-- WHERE id = 'DEVICE_ID_HERE';
