## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. **SQL Rate Calculation Function is Broken** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File:** `web/src/lib/rateCalculationFunction.sql`  
**Impact:** **All energy cost calculations may be inaccurate**

**The Bug:**
- Winter rate logic doesn't properly split usage across multiple rate periods
- Uses "simplified approximation" that only looks at start time
- Example: 7 AM to 5 PM usage (crosses 3 rate periods) calculates incorrectly

**Example of Incorrect Calculation:**
```
Usage: 7:00 AM - 5:00 PM (10 hours) @ 100W
Current (WRONG): Uses rate based on 7 AM start = $0.24 for all 10 hours = $0.24
Correct: Should be:
  - 7-8 AM: 1h @ $0.24 (Off-Peak)
  - 8-4 PM: 8h @ $0.24 (Super Off-Peak)  
  - 4-5 PM: 1h @ $0.52 (Mid-Peak)
  Total: $0.268
```

**Fix Created:** ‚úÖ `web/src/lib/rateCalculationFunction-fixed.sql`

**Action Required:**
1. Review the fixed SQL function
2. Run it in Supabase SQL Editor to replace the old function
3. Test with the provided test cases
4. Verify existing energy log costs are recalculated correctly

---

### 2. **Duplicate Rate Calculation Code**
**Files:** `utils/rateCalculator.ts` + `utils/rateCalculations.ts`

**Problem:**
- Two different implementations exist
- UI preview uses `rateCalculator.ts`
- Database uses SQL function
- May produce different results

**Recommendation:**
- Keep `rateCalculator.ts` (used by UI)
- Remove `rateCalculations.ts` (only has tests, not used)
- Ensure `rateCalculator.ts` matches fixed SQL function logic

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 3. **Bill Split - Shared Device Cost Allocation**
**File:** `pages/BillSplit.tsx`

**Current Behavior:**
- Shared device costs are split evenly among ALL family members
- Doesn't use `assigned_users` from energy logs

**Example Issue:**
- Samsung TV used only by Thuy & Han
- Current: Cost split among all 4 members (Vu, Thuy, Vy, Han)
- Expected: Cost split only between Thuy & Han

**Recommendation:**
- Implement proper user assignment logic
- Split shared device costs only among users who actually used it

---

### 4. **Timezone Issues** (Partially Fixed)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in EnergyLogs, ‚ö†Ô∏è May exist elsewhere

**Fixed:**
- Energy log date display now uses local timezone

**Still Need to Check:**
- Dashboard date calculations
- Bill split date range filtering
- Any `new Date(dateString)` without timezone handling

---

## üìã MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 5. **Energy Log User Assignments** (Incomplete)
**Database Table:** `energy_log_users` ‚úÖ Exists  
**UI Implementation:** ‚ùå Partial

**Missing:**
- View which users were assigned to a log
- Cost split calculation per user for shared devices
- Filter logs by assigned user

---

### 6. **Bill Splits Persistence** (Not Saved)
**Database Table:** `bill_splits` ‚úÖ Exists  
**Current:** Only saves to local state (lost on refresh)

**Missing:**
- Save bill splits to database
- View historical bill splits
- Edit/delete saved splits

---

### 7. **Device Usage Analytics** (Not Implemented)
**Missing Features:**
- Cost per device over time
- Most expensive devices ranking
- Usage pattern analysis
- Peak vs off-peak breakdown per device

---

### 8. **Budget & Alerts** (Not Implemented)
**Missing Features:**
- Set monthly budget
- Usage alerts when approaching budget
- Cost projections

---

## ‚úÖ RECENTLY FIXED ISSUES (This Session)

1. ‚úÖ **Bill Split Device Detection** - Now checks both `is_shared` and `sharing_type`
2. ‚úÖ **Edit Log Creating Duplicate** - Now properly updates existing logs
3. ‚úÖ **Update Error on Device Change** - Recalculates cost correctly
4. ‚úÖ **Date Display Timezone** - Fixed in EnergyLogs.tsx (lines 727, 790)
5. ‚úÖ **Cache Not Clearing** - Added force refresh on bill split calculation

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Do Now)**
1. ‚úÖ **Replace SQL rate calculation function** with fixed version
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test all existing energy logs** - Verify costs are accurate
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Add calculation tests** - Prevent future regressions

### **Phase 2: Data Accuracy (This Week)**
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement proper shared device cost allocation** using assigned_users
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Audit all date/timezone handling** across the app
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consolidate rate calculation code** - Remove duplicates

### **Phase 3: Missing Features (Next Sprint)**
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement bill splits persistence** - Save to database
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Complete energy_log_users implementation** - Full user assignment flow
9. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Add device analytics dashboard**

### **Phase 4: Enhancements (Future)**
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Add rate period visualization**
11. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implement budget tracking**
12. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Add comprehensive data export**

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

### Critical Test Cases:
- [ ] Summer weekday: 3 PM - 5 PM (crosses On-Peak boundary)
- [ ] Summer weekend: 3 PM - 5 PM (crosses Mid-Peak boundary)
- [ ] Winter: 7 AM - 5 PM (crosses 3 rate periods) **‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN BUG**
- [ ] Overnight: 11 PM - 2 AM (crosses midnight)
- [ ] Exactly at boundary: 4:00 PM start/end
- [ ] Season boundary: May 31 to June 1

### Data Integrity Tests:
- [ ] No energy logs - Dashboard shows empty state
- [ ] No devices - Energy log form handles gracefully
- [ ] Single user household - Bill split works
- [ ] All shared devices - Bill split splits evenly
- [ ] All personal devices - Bill split assigns correctly

## üìà CODE QUALITY METRICS

**Positive:**
- ‚úÖ Good component structure
- ‚úÖ TypeScript usage
- ‚úÖ Error handling generally present
- ‚úÖ Demo mode works well
- ‚úÖ UI/UX is polished

**Needs Improvement:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Calculation logic scattered across multiple files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some incomplete features (started but not finished)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited test coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some edge cases not handled

---

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

1. **The SQL function bug is the most critical issue** - All cost calculations may be wrong for winter multi-period usage

2. **Recent fixes were good** - Bill split device detection and edit functionality now work correctly

3. **Database schema is well-designed** - Tables exist for features that aren't fully implemented yet

4. **Code is maintainable** - Well-structured, just needs consolidation and completion of features

---

## üìù DELIVERABLES FROM THIS AUDIT

1. ‚úÖ **AUDIT_FINDINGS.md** - Detailed technical findings
2. ‚úÖ **AUDIT_SUMMARY.md** - This executive summary
3. ‚úÖ **rateCalculationFunction-fixed.sql** - Fixed SQL function with tests
4. ‚úÖ **Recent bug fixes** - Bill split, edit log, timezone issues

---

## üöÄ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. **Review the fixed SQL function** (`rateCalculationFunction-fixed.sql`)
2. **Deploy to Supabase** - Replace the old function
3. **Run test cases** - Verify calculations are now correct
4. **Consider recalculating** existing energy log costs (optional)
5. **Commit all changes** including audit documents

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK ASSESSMENT

**High Risk:**
- Inaccurate cost calculations affecting user trust
- Bill splits may not be fair if shared device logic is wrong

**Medium Risk:**
- Missing features may confuse users
- Timezone issues could cause date display problems

**Low Risk:**
- Performance seems fine
- Security appears adequate (using Supabase RLS)

---

## üìû QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDER

1. **Shared device cost allocation:** Should costs be split among all users or only assigned users?
2. **Bill split persistence:** Priority for saving to database?
3. **Historical data:** Do we need to recalculate existing energy log costs?
4. **Analytics features:** Which analytics are most important to users?
