# Release Notes - Latest Update

## 🎉 Major Features Added

### 1. **Year-Based Analytics & Filtering** 📊
- **Dashboard Filters**: Added 5 filter options instead of 3
  - ✅ Current Year (2025) - **Default**
  - ✅ Current Month
  - ✅ Last Month  
  - ✅ Last Year (2024)
  - ✅ All Time
- **Year-to-Date Card**: New personal analytics card showing full year totals
- **Better Context**: More meaningful for budgeting and year-over-year comparisons
- **Annual Planning**: Perfect for tax reporting and cost tracking

### 2. **Fully Responsive Design** 📱
All new features now work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop:
- **BulkEnergyEntry Modal**: Full-screen on mobile with sticky header/footer
- **MultiDeviceSelector**: Optimized touch targets and stacked layouts
- **TemplatesModal**: Responsive cards and wrapped action buttons
- **RecurringSchedulesModal**: Mobile-friendly schedule management
- **DeleteConfirmationModal**: Full-screen with better readability

**Design Improvements:**
- Mobile-first approach with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints
- Touch-friendly button sizes (larger on mobile)
- Sticky headers/footers for better navigation
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Truncated text to prevent overflow

### 3. **Bulk Entry Bug Fix** 🐛
**Problem**: Tesla 412 kWh entry was showing as 0.0027 kWh
**Cause**: System was recalculating from 1-second time range instead of using stored values
**Solution**: Updated all pages to use stored `total_kwh` and `calculated_cost` first

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ Dashboard.tsx - All calculations
- ✅ EnergyLogs.tsx - Display and totals
- ✅ BillSplit.tsx - Bill splitting logic

**Result**: Bulk entries now display correctly (e.g., 412 kWh ✅ instead of 0.0027 kWh ❌)
