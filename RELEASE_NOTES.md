# Release Notes - October 6, 2025 Update

## 🎉 Major Features Added

### 1. **Year-Based Analytics & Filtering** 📊
- **Dashboard Filters**: Added 5 filter options instead of 3
  - ✅ Current Year (2025) - **Default**
  - ✅ Current Month
  - ✅ Last Month  
  - ✅ Last Year (2024)
  - ✅ All Time
- **Year-to-Date Card**: New personal analytics card showing full year totals
- **Better Context**: More meaningful for budgeting and year-over-year comparisons
- **Annual Planning**: Perfect for tax reporting and cost tracking

### 2. **Fully Responsive Design** 📱
All new features now work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop:
- **BulkEnergyEntry Modal**: Full-screen on mobile with sticky header/footer
- **MultiDeviceSelector**: Optimized touch targets and stacked layouts
- **TemplatesModal**: Responsive cards and wrapped action buttons
- **RecurringSchedulesModal**: Mobile-friendly schedule management
- **DeleteConfirmationModal**: Full-screen with better readability
- **SaveGroupModal & TemplateNameModal**: Adaptive sizing

**Design Improvements:**
- Mobile-first approach with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints
- Touch-friendly button sizes (larger on mobile)
- Sticky headers/footers for better navigation
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Truncated text to prevent overflow

### 3. **Bulk Entry Bug Fix** 🐛
**Problem**: Tesla 412 kWh entry was showing as 0.0027 kWh
**Cause**: System was recalculating from 1-second time range instead of using stored values
**Solution**: Updated all pages to use stored `total_kwh` and `calculated_cost` first

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ Dashboard.tsx - All calculations
- ✅ EnergyLogs.tsx - Display and totals
- ✅ BillSplit.tsx - Bill splitting logic

**Result**: Bulk entries now display correctly (e.g., 412 kWh ✅ instead of 0.0027 kWh ❌)

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes (October 6, 2025)

### **RLS Policy Issues**
- **Fixed circular RLS dependency** on users table causing infinite recursion
- Removed `users_select_household` policy that called `get_user_household_id()`
- Created security definer function for safe household member queries
- Fixed "User has no household_id" errors in contexts
- Fixed "No Household Members Found" error in user assignments

### **Database Trigger Issues**
- **Disabled `energy_logs_calculate_cost` trigger** causing statement timeouts
- Trigger was timing out during bulk operations (error code 57014)
- Frontend already handles cost calculations, trigger was redundant
- Bulk template generation now works without 500 errors

### **Query Fixes**
- Added `household_id` filter to TemplatesModal existing log queries
- Added `household_id` filter to useTemplates bulk generation queries
- Fixed 406 (Not Acceptable) errors when checking for existing logs
- All queries now properly comply with RLS policies

### **SQL Diagnostic Scripts Added**
- Scripts 30-46 for troubleshooting RLS and trigger issues
- Easy verification of policies, triggers, and user data
- Helpful for future debugging

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **RLS Policies**
```sql
-- Safe policies without circular dependencies
users_select_own: (id = auth.uid())
users_select_household_members: (household_id = get_user_household_id())
users_update_own: (id = auth.uid())
```

### **Security Definer Function**
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_user_household_id()
RETURNS UUID
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT household_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1;
$$;
```

### **Trigger Management**
- Removed: `energy_logs_calculate_cost` (caused timeouts)
- Kept: `energy_logs_updated_at` (harmless, updates timestamps)
