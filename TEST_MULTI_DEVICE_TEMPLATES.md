**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ Created 1 log(s) from template!
‚ö†Ô∏è 1 log(s) may overlap with existing entries
```

**Verify:**
- Both logs exist in Energy Logs
- No duplicate (different times)
- Warning appeared

---

### **Test 5: Exact Duplicate Prevention**

**Steps:**
1. Create template: "Test" with Coffee Maker, 10:00-11:00 AM
2. Use template for today
3. Use same template for today again (without "Replace existing")

**Expected Result:**
```
‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped 1 duplicate(s)
```

**Verify:**
- Only 1 log exists
- Second attempt skipped

---

### **Test 6: Edit Multi-Device Template**

**Steps:**
1. Find "Morning Routine" template
2. Click "Edit" button
3. Verify "Multi-Device Mode" is checked
4. Verify all 3 devices are selected
5. Change time to 7:30-8:00 AM
6. Click "Update Template"

**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ Template updated successfully!
```

**Verify:**
- Template shows new time
- Device list unchanged
- Can still use template

---

### **Test 7: Bill Splitting with Multi-Device**

**Steps:**
1. Create logs using multi-device template
2. Go to Bill Split page
3. Enter billing period covering the logs
4. Click "Calculate Split"

**Expected Result:**
- Each device log counted separately
- Costs split among assigned users
- Total matches sum of individual logs

**Example:**
```
Coffee Maker: $0.15 ‚Üí Vu: $0.075, Thuy: $0.075
Toaster: $0.10 ‚Üí Vu: $0.05, Thuy: $0.05
Microwave: $0.12 ‚Üí Vu: $0.06, Thuy: $0.06
---
Total: Vu: $0.185, Thuy: $0.185
```

---

### **Test 8: Dashboard Statistics**

**Steps:**
1. Create logs using multi-device template
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Check device usage breakdown

**Expected Result:**
- Each device shows correct kWh and cost
- Coffee Maker, Toaster, Microwave all listed separately
- Personal vs household stats accurate

---

### **Test 9: Backward Compatibility (Single Device)**

**Steps:**
1. Create template WITHOUT multi-device mode
2. Select single device: TV
3. Set time: 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM
4. Use template

**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ Template created with 1 device(s)!
‚úÖ Created 1 log(s) from template!
```

**Verify:**
- Old single-device templates still work
- No breaking changes

---

### **Test 10: Replace Existing Logs**

**Steps:**
1. Use multi-device template for Oct 5
2. Use same template for Oct 5 again

```
‚úÖ Generated 3 log(s) from template!
```

**Verify:**
- Old logs deleted
- New logs created
- No duplicates

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: "device_ids column not found"**

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Run migration again
-- Copy contents of 52-add-multi-device-templates.sql
-- Paste in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Execute
```

---

### **Issue: Template not creating logs**

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors
2. Supabase logs
3. RLS policies enabled
4. User authenticated

---

### **Issue: Overlap warning not showing**

**Check:**
1. Console logs show overlap detection running
2. Times actually overlap (not just same day)
3. Same device in both logs

---

### **Issue: Bill split incorrect**

**Check:**
1. Each device has separate log
2. Assigned users correct
3. Costs calculated individually
4. No duplicate logs

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All tests pass if:

- ‚úÖ Multi-device templates create multiple logs
- ‚úÖ Overlap detection warns appropriately
- ‚úÖ Exact duplicates are skipped
- ‚úÖ Bill splitting counts each log separately
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows correct statistics
- ‚úÖ Single-device templates still work
- ‚úÖ Edit functionality works for both types
- ‚úÖ Bulk creation works correctly
- ‚úÖ Replace existing logs works
- ‚úÖ No errors in console or Supabase logs

---

## üìä Performance Check

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Template list loads quickly
- [ ] Creating logs is fast (< 2 seconds for 10 logs)
- [ ] No lag when using templates
- [ ] Dashboard renders smoothly
- [ ] Bill split calculates quickly

---

## üéØ Next Steps After Testing

1. **If all tests pass:**
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues
   - Gather user feedback

2. **If tests fail:**
   - Check error messages
   - Review implementation
   - Consult MULTI_DEVICE_TEMPLATE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   - Fix issues and retest
